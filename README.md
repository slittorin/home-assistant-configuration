## Goal

The goal of my Home Assistant installation is to primarily measure and get control of the major cost for my house, electricity.
Secondarily I would like to be able to control and perform automation activities.

## Generic information

#### For changes to Home Assistant configuration files:
1. Goto `Configuration` -> `Settings` -> `Server Controls` and press `Check Configuration`.
   - The output should state 'Configuration valid'. If not, isolate the error.
2. Try not to restart the full Home Manager through `Server Configuration`.
   - All states are lost, and sensors/data are lost that relates to states.
3. Restart only necessary part of Home Assistant at `YAML configuration reloading`.
4. Check logs to verify if there are warnings or errors.
   - Any warnings or errors can be found in the file `/config/home-assistant.log`.
   - It can take up to 1-2 minutes before updates are made.

# Governing principles

- Setup HA with [Home Assistance setup](https://github.com/slittorin/home-assistant-setup).

#### Styles, naming convention, device and state class, and unit of measurement
- Configuration-files/yaml:
  - Do not create more sensors than needed. Rely on the standard integration entities/attributes.
    - Since states (and therefore also InfluxDB states) do not track attribute changes, make sure to create sensors for the attributes you want to track.
      - And of course, where required, create new sensors if attributes cannot be utilized by templates, triggers or other.
  - When retrieving states of sensors, in Jinja2, make sure to check if the value is `unknown` or `unavailable`.
  - Use [Modern configuration format](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/template/#configuration-variables).
  - Follow the [Style guide](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/documenting/yaml-style-guide/).
  - Naming convention for `name:` and `unique_id:`of Sensor/Entity ID (and where required name) shall follow the naming standard:
    - `Device/Type` `area/attribute` `(if required location/zone)` `state/measure` `device` `unit of measurement`.
    - This will render unique id
      - balboa_spa_heater_on
      - balboa_spa_heater_running_time
      - balboa_spa_heater_consumption
      - balboa_spa_heater_consumption_daily
    - When testing, add `test_` before the entity id.
      - However remember that these sensors are not written to history, as we have excluded these sensors in the configuration file, so for instance history_stats will not work with `test_` entites.
  - Utilize [Packages](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/configuration/packages/) to bundle together services/entities in packages.
  - Make sure that the new format to manage functions is utilized from [2021.10.x](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/updating-templates-with-the-new-default-values-in-2021-10-x/346198).
  - To allow Home Assistant to correctly identify and utilize sensors/data, always utilize:
    - When utilizing customized entities, utilize `device_class`. Valid types can be found under each platform [here](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/configuration/customizing-devices/#device-class).
    - Utilize `state_class` where valid when defining sensor/template sensors. Valid types can be found [here](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/core/entity/sensor/#available-state-classes).
      - Note that legacy configuration format (see modern above), do not support `state_class`.
    - Utilize `unit_of_measurement` for all entities/sensors. Standard units is found [here](https://github.com/home-assistant/core/blob/dev/homeassistant/const.py).
    - For power/consumption related sensors one may also look to add integration [Powercalc](https://github.com/bramstroker/homeassistant-powercalc), specifically for binary sensors.
- Scheduled tasks (triggers, automation, backups):
  - Spread out evenly to not put load on specific times (includes towards databases).
  - Use the following as base:
    - 00:01 - 00:59 - Backup timeslot.
    - 01:00 - 01:58 - Triggers, automations and similar.

#### Persistence

Since Home Assistant is a event/state machine there will be some sensors that will not survive a restart.\
This is due to the architectural design and governing principles on how the platform works.

Therefore all integrations must be able to support persistence over restart, dependent on the nature of the integration what the sensors measure.\
It also means that manually added sensors/entities will need to be adapted to support persistence over reboots.

Note must be taken on the following:
- Adding persistence will not only add complexity, but may also affect measurement of statistics and so forth, therefore try not to add persistence.
  - Sensors that for instance are used to track sum of values over time, cannot simply be made persistent, since if we add persistence, it will add value to the sum that was not intended.
- Snapshots are good candidates to made persistent.

Persistence can be made according to the following:
- For automations:
  - Add the following to automation triggers to allow the trigger to be fired after restart of HA:
    ```yaml
    - platform: homeassistant
      event: start
    ```
- For sensors:
  - Create `input_number` of `input_text` sensor to store sensor values (input sensors are persistent over restarts):
    ```yaml
    input_number:
      electrical_consumption_intake_hour_snapshot_persistent:
        name: 'Persistent for electrical_consumption_intake_hour_snapshot'
        icon: mdi:database
        mode: box
        min: 0
        max: 10000000
        unit_of_measurement: "kWh"
    ```
  - Add automation to update input sensor based on (original/tracked) state changes:
    ```yaml
    automation:
    # For persistence, On every state change for electrical_consumption_intake_hour_snapshot, set input_number sensor.
    - id: automation_electrical_consumption_intake_hour_snapshot
      alias: 'Automation for persistance of electrical_consumption_intake_hour_snapshot'
      trigger:
        - platform: state
          entity_id: sensor.electrical_consumption_intake_hour_snapshot
      action:
        service: input_number.set_value
        data_template:
          entity_id: input_number.electrical_consumption_intake_hour_snapshot_persistent
          value: "{{ states('sensor.electrical_consumption_intake_hour_snapshot') }}"
    ```
  - Use template sensors and Jinja2 to check if sensor value is `unknown` or `unavailable` and retrieve the value from the input sensor:
    ```yaml
    - name:  electrical_solar_production_hour
      device_class: 'energy'
      unit_of_measurement: 'kWh'
      state_class: measurement
      state: >
        {% set persistent_snapshot = states('input_number.electrical_consumption_intake_hour_snapshot_persistent') %}
        {% set snapshot = states('sensor.electrical_consumption_intake_hour_snapshot') %}
        {% if (snapshot == 'unknown' or snapshot == 'unavailable') %}
        {%   set snapshot = persistent_snapshot %}
        {% endif %}
    ```

# Resources, Packages and Integrations

## Backup

We want to have the following backup-scheme:
- Daily backups Monday through Saturday, kept for 7 days.
- Weekly backups on Sunday, kept for 8 weeks (56+1 days).

We could have utilized a standard automation scheme, and run a shell-script daily to remove older files, however since the filenaming-convention on file-level fÃ¶r backup files are not readable, we instead utilize a backup-integration [auto-backup](https://github.com/jcwillox/hass-auto-backup) that will take care of the work for us.

1. Through `HACS` in the menu:
   - Add Integration: `Auto Backup` by `@jcwillox`.
2. Restart the Home Assistant server under `Server management`.
   - This may take a while as the custom component is installed.
3. Go to `Configuration` -> `Devices and services` and add Integration `auto backup`.
4. Through the `File Editor` add-on, edit the file [/config/packages/backup.yaml](https://github.com/slittorin/home-assistant-config/blob/master/packages/backup.yaml) and add the following:
   - Daily backup scheme according above.
   - Weekly backup schema according above.
5. For the Auto backup integration:
   - Change backup timeout to 60 minutes.

## Copy backup files to server1

In case we get a server corruption, we also want to copy the files to server1.

Pre-requisite is [Preparation in setup](https://github.com/slittorin/home-assistant-setup#preparation).

See also [Github Copy to server1 in Visualizations - Dashboard Home Assistant](https://github.com/slittorin/home-assistant-visualization#copy-to-server1).

Here we needed to take into consideration the following:
- Ideally we should have have used `rsync`, but this is not installed by default in HA/add-on for Terminal/SSH.
  - Therefore we need to create a script to do a copy.
- Command shell scripts are terminated by HA after 60 seconds.
  - We therefore add `&` to get the script to not be terminated by HA.
  - With the below solution, we will therefore get errors in the log if the copy takes more than 1 minute.
    ```
    2022-03-19 03:01:00 ERROR (MainThread) [homeassistant.components.shell_command] Timed out running command: `/config/scripts/copy_backup.sh pi@192.168.2.30 /srv/ha/backup &`, after: 60s
    ```
- Directory `/backup` is not directly reachable by command shell triggered by HA.
  - But exists the add-on for Terminal/SSH.

Perform the following:
1. Through the `File Editor` add-on, add the file `/config/scripts/copy_backup.sh` and add:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
#
# Purpose:
# Copy backup to other server.
#
# Usage:
# ./copy_backup.sh SERVER REMOTEDIR
#
# Example: ./copy_backup.sh pi@192.168.2.30 /srv/ha/backup
#
# SERVER    - Mandatory. Is the remote server in format: user@NAME/IP.
#             Remember that the server must be able to run commands without password (such as key based login).
# REMOTEDIR - Mandatory. Remote directory.
#
# Since shell commands by default do not have /backup mounted, we do this manually: https://community.home-assistant.io/t/tips-for-shell-command-and-auto-deleting-old-snapshots/207688
# We could have utilized this approach, but chose manual mount: https://community.home-assistant.io/t/shell-command-backup-not-found/273055/8

2. Through the 'SSH & Web terminal' run the following in the `/config/script` directory (change to fit your installation):
   - `chmod ug+x copy_backup.sh`.
   - `copy_backup.sh pi@192.168.2.30 /srv/ha/backup`.
3. Check the log-file `/config/logs/copy_backup.log`.
   - Isolate if there are errors, and if needed isolate the problem.
4. Go to server1 and check that the files exists under `/srv/ha/backup`.
   - Isolate if there are errors, and if needed isolate the problem.
5.  Through the `File Editor` add-on, edit the file [/config/configuration.yaml](https://github.com/slittorin/home-assistant-config/blob/master/configuration.yaml) and add after `shell_command:` (if not already present, add `shell_command:`, mind the spaces. Adapt after your installation):
```yaml
  # We run copy_backup as background process, since otherwise HA will terminate the process after 60 seconds.
  copy_backup: /config/scripts/copy_backup.sh pi@192.168.2.30 /srv/ha/backup &
```
6. Through the `File Editor` add-on, create the file `/config/packages/copy-backup.yaml`
7. Through the `File Editor` add-on, edit the file [/config/configuration.yaml](https://github.com/slittorin/home-assistant-config/blob/master/configuration.yaml) and after `  packages:` (mind the spaces):
```yaml
    copy_backup: !include packages/backup.yaml
```
8. Through the `File Editor` add-on, edit the file [/config/packages/backup.yaml](https://github.com/slittorin/home-assistant-config/blob/master/packages/backup.yaml) and add the following:
   - Input button.
   - Automation to trigger shell_command on press of button.
   - Sensor for retrieving the last row of the log-file for `/config/logs/copy_backup.log`.

## Github Push

We want to utilize Github Push instead of Pull as the original files are to reside on my HA-device.\
Therefore we do not utilize the standard Github Pull integration.\
Inspiration from the [community](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/sharing-your-configuration-on-github/195144).

Note: HASS.io already has git installed, so no need to install git.

Pre-requisities:
- [Preparation in setup](https://github.com/slittorin/home-assistant-setup#preparation).
- That repository `home-assistant-config` is created in Github.

See also [Github Push in Visualizations - Dashboard Home Assistant](https://github.com/slittorin/home-assistant-visualization/blob/main/README.md#dashboard---home-assistant).

Perform the following:

1. If not already done, create a Github personal access token:
   - According [instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token).
   - Set preferably an Expiration date (and keep note of the date and update the token accordingly).
   - Set the following scopes:
     - `repo`.
     - `gists`.
   - Copy the token.
2. Through the `File Editor` add-on, add the following to `.env` in `/config/` (where TOKEN is the copied token, ensure that usename and repository is correct):
   `GITHUB_CONNECT_STRING=https://TOKEN@github.com/slittorin/home-assistant-config`
3. Through the `File Editor` add-on, create `.gitignore` in `/config/` with the following content:
```git config
# .gitignore for Home Assistant.

# First rule: Ignore everything, all files in root and all directories.
*
*/*

# Second rule: Whitelisted folders, these will not be ignored.
!/blueprints/
!/blueprints/**
!/deps/
!/deps/**
!/packages/
!/packages/**
!/scripts/
!/scripts/**
!/tts/
!/tts/**
!/www/
!/www/**

# Third rule: Whitelisted files, these will not be ignored.
!*.yaml
!.gitignore
!*.md
!*.sh

# Fourth rule is more specific, as we want to whitelist certain files in .storage
!/.storage/
!/.storage/lovelace
!/.storage/lovelace.*
!/.storage/lovelace_*

# Last rule: If we make a mistake above, ensure these files are ignored, otherwise your secret data/credentials will leak.
.env
ip_bans.yaml
secrets.yaml
```
4. Through the 'SSH & Web terminal' run the following in the `/config` directory (change your email and name to match your Github account, and ensure that all directories you want to add to Github are present):\
   You will be asked to provide a comment at commit.
```bash
git init
git config user.email "you@example.com"
git config user.name "Your Name"
```
5. Through the 'SSH & Web terminal' run the following in the `/config` directory (where TOKEN is the copied token, ensure that usename and repository is correct):\
   Note that git push can give error, that is nothing to trouble shoot.
```bash
git remote add origin https://TOKEN@github.com/slittorin/home-assistant-config
git push -u origin master
```
6. Through the `File Editor` add-on, add the file `/config/scripts/github_push.sh` and add:
```bash
#!/bin/bash

4. Through the `File Editor` add-on, edit the file [/config/packages/balboa_spa.yaml](https://github.com/slittorin/home-assistant-config/blob/master/packages/balboa_spa.yaml) and add the following:
   - History stats to keep track of how long time the circulation pump and header has been running.
   - We cannot track attribute-state in history_stats, we need to create a binary template-sensor.
   - Keep track of accumulated (daily) consumption for the circulation pump and heater.
     - Circulation pump: 0.2 kW + 0.1 kW for the ozone-device (that takes 0.2 kW, but we assume that the ozone-device is only running 50% of the time).
     - Heater 3 kW.
